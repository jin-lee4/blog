Hi everyone! After months of a gruelling job search, I am happy to announce that I am still unemployed! I'd like to thank all those who ghosted me and my friends who entertained my "it's not too late to hear back yet, right?" delusions.

After repeating "if I get this job, I'm going to write a LinkedIn post" for months, I did not get a job and I am not going to post on LinkedIn. I'll probably be blacklisting LinkedIn for a while. I sort of abandoned this blog after making some heavy proclamations, but that's only because I've been busy keeping my promises.

Jin's Corporate Winter 2024 Wrapped:

-   17 job applications

-   4 coffee chats

-   3 hackathons

-   3 networking events

-   2 interviews

Rookie numbers, but each one came with obsession, a week's recovery, and a rollercoaster of emotions.

These last few months have been an electric shock from a deep slumber, but now I'm recalibrating. I want to focus on what "work" really means to me. I fell down the corporate-if-you-work-hard-enough-you'll-get-it rabbit hole - it's so easy to get sucked in as a fear response to our current reality. I wanted to spend the summer floating down the lazy river of the 9-5 because it would give me some form of physical purpose, something to have to wake up for and shape my day around. I wanted a job to shape the start of my summer/year/career/post-graduation life around. I have always scorned workaholics but this place of fear and uncertainty has given me a lot of empathy for them.

Now I know that my work must be intentional and a form of resistance.

Next is the summer of research, learning, and cultivating. In some literal ways (school), and more personal (moving back home, no structured schedule). And hopefully more writing about indulgent musings (still holding onto the Netflix Reality TV Cinematic Universe idea), and less of LinkedIn brain rot stuff.

Other things I did this winter:

-   Showed unfiltered enthusiasm when trying to become friends with someone

-   Started my cardio mentality monster month (today is day 12/31!)

-   Listened to my body and realized that a deep breath through the nose can be something so healing

-   A song a day playlists 

-   Went to the dentist for the first time in 2+ years

-   Rewatched Modern Family 

-   Hit 100 contributions for this year on GitHub!

-   Enjoyed my last few months in the Yellow House with my roommates <3
