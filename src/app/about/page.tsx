        <p>Hi, I'm Jin! I'm a fifth-year student at the University of British Columbia studying Cognitive Systems
            with a focus on Brain and Cognition. I'm particularly into learning about human-computer interactions, and
            the relationship between the development of AI and systemic structures. In my free time, I like to watch movies, 
            cook, and try lots of yummy drinks.
        </p>
